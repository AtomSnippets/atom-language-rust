# Rust language support for the Atom editor

## Install

Install the package `language-rust` in Atom (Preferences->Packages) or use this shell command:

    # apm install language-rust

## Bugs

Grammar rules were written from scratch. They seem to work for most cases. However there are most certainly still a few cases that result in wrong syntax highlighting. Feel free to fix it and send a pull request, or open an issue to report it.
